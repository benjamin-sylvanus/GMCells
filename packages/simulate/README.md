# Simulate

The Simulation module enables the generation of 3D Monte Carlo diffusion simulations based on preprocessed neuron skeleton data. This module provides the necessary tools and algorithms to model realistic diffusion processes and generate synthetic diffusion-weighted images. The following steps outline the usage of this module:

1. **Input Data**: Start by ensuring you have the preprocessed neuron skeleton data ready for simulation. This data should undergo preprocessing, including neurite correction, coordinate transformation, resampling, and normalization, as performed by the Preprocessing module. Load the preprocessed data into the Simulation module for further processing.
2. **Lookup Table Creation**: Create a lookup table that maps the neuron properties to diffusion parameters. This table is essential for simulating realistic diffusion behavior based on the characteristics of the neuron skeleton data. The module provides functions to generate the lookup table based on user-defined parameters and assumptions.
3. **Simulation Parameter Generation**: Generate the necessary simulation parameters based on the preprocessed neuron data and the created lookup table. These parameters include diffusion coefficients, compartment models, gradient orientations, and strengths. The Simulation module offers functionalities to customize and fine-tune these parameters according to your specific simulation requirements.
4. **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Utilize the Monte Carlo simulation algorithms to model the diffusion process within the neuron skeleton. This step involves simulating the random walk of diffusion particles and their interactions with the neuron structure. The module performs Monte Carlo simulations based on the generated simulation parameters, providing a realistic representation of diffusion within the neuron.
5. **Synthetic Image Generation**: Generate synthetic diffusion-weighted images based on the Monte Carlo simulations and the simulation parameters. This step produces images that mimic real diffusion MRI acquisitions, capturing the effects of diffusion and the underlying neuron geometry. The Simulation module provides functions to generate 3D volumes or slices representing the diffusion-weighted images.
6. **Visualization and Evaluation**: Visualize the simulated diffusion-weighted images and evaluate their quality and realism. Utilize the module's visualization tools to inspect the generated images and compare them with ground truth or reference data. Evaluate diffusion metrics, such as fractional anisotropy (FA) or mean diffusivity (MD), to assess the accuracy and reliability of the simulations.
7. **Export**: Once satisfied with the simulations and evaluation, export the simulated diffusion-weighted images, simulation parameters, and evaluation results for further analysis, post-processing, or integration into the Post-processing module.
