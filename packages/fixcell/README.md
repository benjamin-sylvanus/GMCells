### Neurite Correction Module

The Neurite Correction module provides tools and functionalities to correct and enhance neurite skeleton data for more accurate diffusion MRI simulations. This module addresses common challenges such as noise, gaps, and artifacts in the neuron data. The following steps outline the usage of this module:

1. **Input Data**: Start by ensuring you have the neuron skeleton data ready for correction. This data should be in a compatible format, such as SWC or JSON. Load the data into the module for processing.
2. **Noise Reduction**: Apply noise reduction algorithms to eliminate unwanted noise or spurious connections in the neuron skeleton. The module offers various filtering techniques and parameters to adjust the level of noise reduction.
3. **Gap Filling**: Detect and fill gaps or missing segments in the neurite skeleton. Utilize the module's algorithms to interpolate missing data points or intelligently connect discontinuous segments for a more continuous and accurate representation.
4. **Artifact Removal**: Identify and remove artifacts that may arise due to imaging or reconstruction processes. The module provides functionalities to detect and eliminate these artifacts, enhancing the quality and reliability of the corrected neuron data.
5. **Visualization and Evaluation**: Visualize the corrected neurite skeleton to verify the effectiveness of the correction process. Use the module's visualization capabilities to inspect the results and assess the improvements made.
6. **Export**: Once satisfied with the correction, export the corrected neurite skeleton data in a compatible format for further processing or integration into subsequent modules.
